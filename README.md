Now creating an unordered list:
- Git is interesting
- You need to practice
- This is a new concept for me
- Trying to learning

Now I will try to make an ordered list:
1. Learning terminal is must
2. Then leaning GitHub is must
3. Then learning smartgit is important

Now will try to make nested list:
- Point 1
    - nested point 1
 - Point 2
    - nested point 2
      - Another point
Task list will be given below:

- [x] initial Git learniing is done

- [ ] Practice still required

- [ ] Book needs to be read
